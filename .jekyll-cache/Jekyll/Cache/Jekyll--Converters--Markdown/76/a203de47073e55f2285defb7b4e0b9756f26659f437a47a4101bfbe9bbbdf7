<h2 id="stonehenge-and-the-solstice">Stonehenge and the Solstice</h2>

<p>For those who built Stonehenge between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE, the winter solstice marked when the days once again grew longer. <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/what-is-the-winter-solstice/">More important than the summer solstice</a>, the winter solstice was a time of feasts and celebrations, with the cattle newly slaughtered and the wine freshly fermented.</p>

<p>Today, the pagan and druid communities continue to celebrate the winter solstice at Stonehenge, which is a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373/">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. Each year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2018/12/20/winter-solstice-2018-pagans-celebrate-shortest-day-year-day/">thousands flock to the Neolithic monument to welcome the new sun</a> â€“ as a result, the winter solstice at Stonehenge is celebrated the morning after the shortest day.</p>

<p>Note that designated times near the solstices are among the only times each year when the public is allowed to enter into the stone circle itself â€“ itâ€™s normally roped off and only accessible on a <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/plan-your-visit/stone-circle-access-visits/">special Â£45 tour</a>.</p>

<p>See below for my guide to seeing the winter solstice at Stonehenge by public transport!</p>

<h2 id="logistic-essentials"><strong>Logistic Essentials</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Trip length:</strong> December 21-22</p>

<p><strong>Dates/times:</strong> Sunrise on December 22 (morning after the winter solstice). Taking public transport necessitates spending December 21 in the nearby area.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Stonehenge, UK</p>

<p><strong>Public transport:</strong> Take the train/bus to Salisbury on December 21, spend the night in Salisbury, and take the morning 6:20am bus to Stonehenge (Â£10 return). There are no trains early enough from London to avoid spending the night in Salisbury. The morning bus service is specially offered by the <a href="https://www.salisburyreds.co.uk/">local Salisbury bus company</a>. Check back around the winter solstice for the exact bus schedule!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cost saving tip:</strong> See if itâ€™s cheaper to separately book one-way advance fare non-flexible train tickets and/or one-way advance fare non-flexible bus tickets! Instead of buying round trip train/bus tickets, I bought a one-way advance fare train ticket from London to Salisbury and a one-way advance fare bus ticket from Salisbury back to London, saving Â£10!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cost from London:</strong> Â£60 + food (Â£20-30 for return train/bus tickets from London to Salisbury + Â£10 return bus tickets from Salisbury to Stonehenge + Â£25 for overnight lodging). Despite the need for an overnight stay, visiting Stonehenge for the winter solstice costs roughly the same as visiting Stonehenge on a day trip during a normal time of year. For the winter solstice sunrise, there is no entrance fee (<a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/prices-and-opening-times/">normally Â£17.50/Â£15.80 for adults/students</a>) and the bus fare is cheaper (<a href="https://gosouthcoast.digitickets.co.uk/category/4767">normally Â£15</a> instead of Â£10 for the solstice).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visiting during the winter solstice is cheaper/similar in price than visiting during a normal time of the year!</p>
