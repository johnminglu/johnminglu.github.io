<p>Scotland boasts five UNESCO sites, with a sixth (<a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430">Antonine Wall</a>) shared with the Hadrianâ€™s Wall in England. Yet beyond these sites, Scotland has natural beauty unmatched in Europe. From the rolling hills (bens) and valleys (glens) of Glencoe to the rugged slopes of Skye, northern Scotland makes visitors want to grow a long beard and buy an axe. Be prepared to enter a desolate but charming land, captured in the popular imagination by <em>Braveheart</em> and fictionalized as the North in <em>Game of Thrones</em> (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/game-of-thrones-red-wedding-black-dinner-real-events_n_3393099.html">the Red Wedding episode was inspired by the Glencoe Massacre of the Highlands</a>).</p>
